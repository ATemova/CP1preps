/*Write a program that asks the user to type a positive integer. When the user types a negative
value the program writes ERROR and asks for another value. When the user types 0, that
means that the last value has been typed and the program must write the average of the
positive integers. If the number of typed values is zero the program writes 'NO AVERAGE*/
