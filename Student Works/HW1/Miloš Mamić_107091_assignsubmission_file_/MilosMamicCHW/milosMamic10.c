/*
Simulate an elevator-controller program. The Elevator should be able to travel between five
floors namely Ground, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th floor. The elevator can either travel going up or
going down. The elevator can only contain one passenger (which is the current user of the
program). Initially, the elevator begins and loads at the ground floor. If the user wants to travel to
the 4th floor, the elevator shall go to the said floor. It is the option of the user if they want to
leave the elevator or not.
You may apply necessary visuals when needed. Realistic rules should apply: If the user leaves
at the 3rd floor, when it rides the elevator again, it should begin travelling from the 3rd floor.
Your program should have validation controls. Only valid characters should be received by the
program (G, 1, 2, 3, 4). If the user enters ‘-1’, the program should be able to handle such input.
It should not crash. Do not use GOTO statements

My thinking behind it is that we shall need alot of if statements
tho i have no idea what the output would be so i do not have
a concrete idea of doing this problem */
