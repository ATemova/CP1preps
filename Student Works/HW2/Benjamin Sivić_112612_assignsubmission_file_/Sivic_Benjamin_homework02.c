    This program takes a positive integer N and searches for the minimum positive integer K, such that K! is a multiple of the square of N!

    The program does not give me correct values if the input is higher than 5, it just prints 10 or 34.
    Even when I changed the type to double the problem persisted.

    I tried using fmod, but I was not able to implement it correctly into my existing code, I would have to rewrite it completely.
    I checked if I put & where needed etc. and it would either just crash the program or give me a number like 622643 no matter how high I put the range for checking in checkMult();
