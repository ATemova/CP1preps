Challenge 01
cipher = encrypt or hide 
decipher = to unlock the code

will receive an input word (c string) 
and replace a certain character with a different character

'a', replace it with '5'
'e', replace it with 'X
o' or 'u', replace it with 'Q'

hint: sInput[dCtr]='5';

input: "monkey" 
output: "mQnkXy"

print the encrypted string 

Challenge 02

Write a C Program that allows the user to accept 4 equations (no spaces). 
Hint: 1 variable per equation. 
Your program should be able to do the following:
> Compare if your equations are the same (is eq1 same as eq2 and eq3 and so on)
> %%Count the number of basic operators (+, -, *, / only). 
> If possible, put all + operators in eq1, - operators in eq2, * in ep3 and / in eq4
> Print the new 4 equations. 
> hint: use strcmp, strstr/strchr, strcat. You may need to use an extra string as buffer.

 sample input: 
> y + c
> z + c - y * d
> a * b + d
> b / a + 1

output
> eq1 = y + c + c + z + d + 1
> eq2 = - y 
> eq3 = a * b * d
> eq4 = b / a
